# The Monkees – Rock Band

I have created my first Milestone project based on the 1960s rock band “The Monkees”. Having studied HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, I was able to create a website for the band easily and quickly using the codes Ive learned in the first three Modules of the course. This first project was definitely a positive result for me as I`ve learned what the code can do and seeing the end result (the website created by me) is definitely a strong point for my self-esteem.

# UX

This website is designated to current and future fans that wish to learn a little bit more about the bands history, it`s members and their careers and to listen to their latest tracks and view their newest video clips. Having a central place, such as a website, where fans are kept updated with the latest and newest, tracks and videos of the band, is the best way to grow the bands popularity. Seeing the bands Events schedule and being able to buy tickets through the website makes the connection between the band and their fans even stronger and in the same time a much easier way for the fans reaching to their favourite artists.

# Features

The website is structured in five pages, all of them used to their fullest and each page promotes an aspect of the band. Home Page – the Home page relates every aspect about the band itself. The origins and how it formed, a brief description about each member, the bands reunion and the unforgettable TV show.

The Monkees – this page has been dedicated to every member of the band. A more in depth description about every artist and their life as musicians, businessmen, actors throughout their lives.

**Tracks** – the tracks page has been created at the request of the band, to showcase the bands newest tracks for their fans to listen and download. Their latest videos are always shown on this page first in order to increase the site`s visits. A good marketing strategy that definitely attracts more fans from all over the world.

**Events** – this is a “must have” page for every solo artist or band that prides itself with having to perform in concerts globally, showing their next concerts and giving an opportunity to its fans to book their tickets right from this page.

**Contact** – like every band that wants to hear from their fans, outside of a concert, this contact page has been created for every fans to easily get in touch with the band.

##Testing

Upton creating the website, I have tested its functionality to ensure the users are experiencing a positive feel about their connection with the band.

Having tested all pages and clicked all clickable action, I am positive the site work as it should allowing the fans to learn more about them, listed to their songs, download them, view their latest video clips, contacting them directly through the contact page as well as buying tickets to their concerts.

From the bands point of view and as they requested, the purpose of building the site was to give something back to their fans. To create a stronger connection with them, allowing them to listen, view and book tickets to their shows. It was also intended to inform the fans of their next concerts and where would they next perform, and generally to make themselves known more through presenting the band as a group as well as presenting themselves as individuals.

From a fans point of view, the website is the perfect way of to find out more about the band, the bands members, their latest tracks, videos and future concerts. Being able to buy tickets to their shows makes the experience even easier and more pleasant.

As an example of testing the website, if we are looking at the Tracks page and test the music player we will find that it works perfectly every time. Upon clicking the play button, the song starts playing and the button changes to a “pause” button that can be actioned whenever we want to pause the song. There is also a timer for every song, showing the elapsed time as well as the total time of the song to inform the user how long has the song played for, out of the total time of the song. We also have a “track bar” that tracks and shows the progress of each song. Moving further to the right, we have a “speaker” button that when is actioned it will mute the song instantly. The last setting of the music player is the three small squares align vertically, that, when actioned, it shows a “download” feature that works perfectly and it downloads the song immediately to the users operating systems download folder.
